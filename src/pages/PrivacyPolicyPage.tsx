                    The information we collect includes:
                    <br />
                    Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related,

                    automatically collect when you access or use our Services
                    and which we record in log files. Depending on how you

                    viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which

                    activity, error reports (sometimes called &quot;crash
                    dumps&quot;), and hardware settings).
                    <br />
                    Device Data. We collect device data such as information
                    about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use
                    to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this
                    device data may include information such as your IP address
                    (or proxy server), device and application identification
                    numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet

                    Location Data. We collect location data such as information
                    about your device&apos;s location, which can be either
                    precise or imprecise. How much information we collect
                    depends on the type and settings of the device you use to
                    access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other
                    technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your
                    current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out
                    of allowing us to collect this information either by
                    refusing access to the information or by disabling your
                    Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to
                    opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the
                    Services.

                    We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like
                    web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you
                    interact with our Services. Some online tracking

                    preferences, and assist with basic site functions.
                    <br />
                    We also permit third parties and service providers to use
                    online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics
                    and advertising, including to help manage and display

                <p>
                    In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary
                    to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice
                    unless otherwise required by law.
                    <br />
                    We will only keep your personal information for as long as
                    it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy
                    Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or
                    permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
                    requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us
                    keeping your personal information for longer than the period
                    of time in which users have an account with us.

                    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process
                    your personal information, we will either delete or
                    anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for
                    example, because your personal information has been stored
                    in backup archives), then we will securely store your
                    personal information and isolate it from any further
                    processing until deletion is possible.
                    <br />
                </p>
                <h2>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
                <p>
                    In Short: We aim to protect your personal information
                    through a system of organizational and technical security
                    measures.
                    <br />
                    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
                    organizational security measures designed to protect the
                    security of any personal information we process. However,
                    despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your

                    information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
                    secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
                    cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not
                    be able to defeat our security and improperly collect,
                    access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will
                    do our best to protect your personal information,
                    transmission of personal information to and from our
                    Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
                    Services within a secure environment.

                    information from users less than 18 years of age has been
                    collected, we will deactivate the account and take
                    reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our

                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and
                    mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;)

                    preference not to have data about your online browsing
